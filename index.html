				This is the beginning of my blog. I'm writing this blog mostly for two reasons. The first reason is to expand my skills in web developement. So this is a way i can see my progress over time.<br> The second reason why i am writing this blog is to have a place where i can write my thoughts down, my feelings, and just anything that i want to talk about at the time. <br> I will post below a screenshot of what the website looks like now so in a few months i can come back here and see how different it looks. I'm praying that it does lol. So let's begin shall we!

				<h2>My First Post</h2>

			<p>
				Well here we are at my first post. Throughout my short time here on Mother Earth, and my even shorter time in the Computer Science field I have struggled. I struggled with the concepts, with my motivations. Hell, i don't even remember why i even wanted to get into this field. Was it because i really did want to create things and learn how to code. Was it because i wasn't really interested in anything; all i wanted to do was play video games, and Computer Science was the closet thing to that school wise. But lets be real here guys, all i wanted to do was play video games. I wasn't interested in making them. So what was it, was it because i wanted to make my parents proud of me? So i chose a career that i could make a lot of money in? Isn't the point to do something you're interested in so your job can be something you can actually be excited to do? Well what i was interested in growing up was space, and weather. I loved looking at pictures and trying to understand more about both of those things. So how the hell did i end up in Computer Science? I think you are starting to see why i struggled through school. I had zero motivation to learn it, to get good at it. I did the minimal to get by, and got help right away instead of trying to figure it out on my own because i wanted to learn and expand my abilities.

				<br/><br/>

				I guess the one good thing that i can look back and be proud about is that i actually never quit. For some reason i still went to every class, tried to take down every note i could possibly take, and i guess i tried my best to not fail so i could continue on and finish my degree. One day though, and to be honeset with you, i don't really know why. This thought flashed through my mind, and i just froze for a few minutes. I began to think really hard about what had just struck through my mind. i was twenty-five years old, i had about 2 more semesters before i was going to graduate, i didn't know shit, and i hadn't done shit or even remembered a line of code that i had written.

				<br/><br/>

				That was one of the scariest thoughts that has ever gone through my mind. It almost literally scared the shit out of me. From that day on though, it movivated me. It actually made me want to learn this stuff, but at the same time i knew it was going to be extremely difficult. Unfortunatly i was already extremely behind. If i had the chance to start over again from the beginning of college i would do it in a heart beat, but in this life there are no resets, and as far as i know time machines don't exist. It's better late than never so i better strap on and start actually practicing this shit.

				<br/><br/>

				Even though i didn't know anything worth even talking about, i was trying my best to learn stuff so i could catch up a little bit, and also begin looking for jobs. I knew that if i didn't start now I was just going to be left behind. I didn't really know what to expect, should i be sad if no company wants to hire me, i mean it's not like they are hiring someone that knows something. Should i be opimistic that maybe, just maybe some company will take a gamble on me and give me a chance? So as time went by i continued to do some studying, I give a presentation for a class which really motivated me because i was able to bring in a field i was really interested in like meterology and tie it together with computer science and i got a perfect score on it. That made me feel good about myself, it made me feel like maybe i can do this. Maybe i will be able to accompish some of my goals.

				<br/><br/>

				The week of graduation came, and so did a special email. I was given a job interview. At the moment i didn't know what to think. Was this actually real? Was i really this close to getting a job? I had thought about this moment for so long! Did i really turn my life around? Did i really reach the goal i had set to myself? Well, i went to my job interview and i <strong>KILLLLLLED</strong> it, and they gave me the position. I had never been so happy in my life. I just started to cry, but these tears, they were tears of happines.

				<br/><br/>

				So theres my first post. I just wanted to put down some content right now so i can have some stuff that i can practice on and modify. I hope to continue to update this blog frequently. Some times i'll make big post about things going on in my life as far as things that i do, and work. Other times i'll just make smaller posts talking about some of the changes that i've made to the website. So hopefully by my next post this website will look a little different.
